CS224W Fall 2014 Final Project
====================

In this project, we will examine different approaches to modeling the Ebola 
outbreak in Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea. This project is currently in 
its early stages of implementation. Our high-level goal is to see how varying 
intra-county network structure and parameters within a larger macro-level graph
connecting counties within a country affects our ability to model the Ebola 
outbreak at the county level.
